I have been accepted into the [AWS Community Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) program. The program provides resources and networking opportunities across a range of AWS services. My focus will be in the machine learning category, but I hope to investigate other topics such as IoT and web applications. I will be sharing what I learn here, on [BearID Project](https://bearresearch.org/) and on my new [DEV Community blog](https://dev.to/bluevalhalla).

For my initial thoughts on what I'm hoping to get out of the program, check out my first post on the DEV Community, [AWS Community Builders: My First Step](https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-community-builders-my-first-step-2b07).
