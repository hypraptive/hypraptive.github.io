As part of Microsoftâ€™s [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program, BearID was invited to apply for an Azure Percept Pilot Grant. The grant provides an [Azure Percept DK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-percept/overview-azure-percept-dk), a development kit for edge AI. The goal will be to see if we can run aspects of _bearid_ on this IoT device.

Once the project is complete, I will have the opportunity to write a post on an Azure IoT blog. I'll link to it from this blog when it's ready, probably in early 2022.
